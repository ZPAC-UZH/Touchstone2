# Touchstone2

Touchstone2 is a web application for designing in controlled experiments. Try out a live server at [touchstone2.org](https://touchstone2.org)


## Requirements

* (On macOS:) Install Xcode. (We use several packages that need Xcode for compiling.)
* Node.js version 8.4. The easiest way to do this is to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation-and-update)
  * To install Node.js 8.4, use the command `nvm install 8.4`
  * To switch to Node.js 8.4, use the command `nvm use 8.4`

## Installation

In the source code folder, run `npm install`. (This will take a while.)

## Running

From now on, you can start Touchstone2 by running: `npm run start`

## Logging

Logging is deactivated by default to activate it.

- `HistorySaga.js` uncomment `xmlhttp.send(data)`
- `constants/settings.js` add `UrlLog`

## Credits

Touchstone2 is a work by the [People and Computing Lab (ZPAC) at the University of Zurich](https://zpac.ch) and the [ex)situ lab](https://ex-situ.lri.fr/).
